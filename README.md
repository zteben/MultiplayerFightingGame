## About the project
Welcome! 😁
This is a server-based multiplayer 2D combat game. Up to 2 players can play in a lobby until one's health reaches zero, as shown below:

The objective of this project was to explore game development, and acquire experience working with a server. Moreover, we aimed to create a fun game that reminisces the superpowers we imagined we had when playing as kids 💪🦹 (in fact, the background of the game was inspired by our childhood playground).

As there are improvements to be made to the game, the project is still in development. 

## Tasks of the project:
* [x] Setting up Menu and lobbies (with the server)
* [x] Character Movement
* [x] Attack and Healthbar
* [x] Win and Defeat Screen
* [ ] Fixing lag
* [ ] Adding Characters + Character-Select Menu
* [ ] Adding Attack-moves
* [ ] Improving Aesthetics

## Built using:
